  <div class="about-content">
    <p>
      I am a Computer Science undergraduate at Lovely Professional University (LPU),
      where my academic journey has been driven by a strong focus on fundamentals,
      structured learning, and problem-solving. Starting from basic programming
      concepts, I gradually developed an interest in understanding how systems work
      internally and how software can be built efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my time at LPU, I strengthened my foundation in Data Structures and
      Algorithms, which significantly improved my logical thinking and approach
      to solving complex problems. Alongside this, I explored Machine Learning,
      gaining hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model building, and
      evaluation through academic and personal projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also focused on learning practical tools and workflows such as Git, Linux,
      Docker, and basic DevOps practices to better understand real-world software
      development and deployment. These experiences have shaped my mindset as a
      learner who values consistency, clarity, and continuous improvement while
      working toward building reliable and scalable solutions.
